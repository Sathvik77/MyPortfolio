            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h2>Hello! My name is Sai Sathvik Kampati, and I am currently pusruing my masters at Pace University in the field of computer science. 
               I am an International Student from India. Prior to attending Pace University, I graduated from NIIT University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2019.
             <h2>   I am passionate about learning new languages and code to bring new outputs. In my college journey, i tried working with various languages/interfaces like C/C++, Java, Python, MySQL, html, Css, JavaSrcipt, ReactJs and making some end products using some of them. I have done a few projects like Interacting AI Chatbot, Hotel Database Management System and Single Tab Chrome Extension. To know more about them visit the project section of my website.</h2> 
<h2>My profile may not be much interesting in terms of projects having end-products, but i can assure that even the smallest project made me learn many new skills which i can use in future projects.</h2>
<h2>Sincerity with dedication is what defines my way of working. I believe one should always stay on the path until he reaches his end goal. It would be very helpful if you can give me suggestions or hire me in the related field to help me grow. </h2>
